# Introduction to Neural Network Applications: Applications to Iris Dataset
This personal project is dedicated to get hands-on experience on neural networks are. In this application we seek to use the Iris Dataset (provided by University of California, Irvine), which is just a data set on different types of flowers. 

## Goal: 
Build a neural network model that can correctly classify Iris flowers. 

## Methodologies
In the context of this project, we'll be using Python, PyTorch, and other libraries
